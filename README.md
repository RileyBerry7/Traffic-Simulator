## 🏬Traffic Simulator _🚗____🚙🛻___🚓___

This is supposed to be a program that is able to simulate vehicle traffic at the macro scale. The road network is implemented as linked graph. A general goal for this is to look like city skylines. I just find traffic simulators really cool and have been wanting to make one. 

## Backlog
-  user-tooling, for generating the road network
-  graph storage and persistency (probably a .csv populated with adjacency matrix)
-  intersection building and display
-  ...
-  Display dynamic car movement
-  Implement Dijkstra's Algorithmn for set road path
-  Allow cars to follow a given path
-  Implement reactive behavior with finite automata
-  Create larger road networks (maybe procedurally generate them, could be fun to learn)
-  ...
-  data collection
-  SQL data storage
-  Pandas/Matplotlib Data analysis
-  OpenGL implementation
-  shaders✨
(overambitious)
